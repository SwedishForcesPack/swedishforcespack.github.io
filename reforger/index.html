  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
   The original Swedish Armed Forces experience for ArmA are now entering the next generation with the first release for Arma Reforger.
  </p>

  <p>
    SFP is now leaving the previous games and relases behind and continue with 100% new content made for Reforger with professional tools with the highest quality. <br/>
    Focus is infantry and the era (1988-1992) represented in Reforger. 
  </p>

  <p>
   Our first release comes with a Conflict version and a coop in order to test our mod, but more missions are planned, both cooperative and competitive with the hopes to bring players from ArmA3 to Reforger as a preperation for ArmA4.
