    <h3>Finnish Forces Pack</h3>

    <p>
       This is a tribute to the orginal FDF mod for Operation Flashpoint. One of the best (if not the best) mod ever made for the Ofp/ArmA series.<br/>
       As there were a severe lack of Finnish content for Arma 3 the SFP team decided to fill that gap.<br/>
       The Finnish Forces Pack started as a side project, but who knows where we will end up.

  <div id="arma-3-sturko">
    <h3>Sturkö</h3>

    <p>
      Sturkö is an island in Blekinge, near one of Swedens largest naval bases, Karlskrona.<br/>
      On the 27 October 1981 at approximatly 20.00, a Soviet submarine ran aground on a skerry in Gåsefjärden, directly east of Sturkö and just 10km from Karlskrona.<br/>
      The Soviets sent a "rescue" party while the Swedish prime minister Thorbjörn Fälldin gave the order to "Hold the border", instructing the Swedish Armed Forces to shoot if any Soviet ships crossed into Swedish waters.<br/>
      Eventually, after a few days, the submarine was salvaged and handed over to the Soviets in international waters, effectively ending the crisis.
